# gemini-cli-reveal
A reveal.js repo with my favorite Gemini CLI tools, subtools, lessons leart and so on.

This deck intends to be a collection of slides that I can use to present:

1. Gemini CLI fetaures, like Custom Commands, extensions and so on.
2. But also ground them in sample extensions, CC, and so on.

It should be very easy to maintain, via github pages. Every time i have a new extension, I add it to the data file.
